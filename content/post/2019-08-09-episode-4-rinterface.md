description: 'In this webinar originally broadcast live in partnership with RStudio Community, [David Granjon](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg) joins Eric and Curtis to discuss the [RinteRface](https://rinterface.com) suite of Shiny user interface packages!  We learned the origins of the project and see how [`{shinydashboardPlus}`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinydashboardPlus), [`{bs4Dash}`](https://rinterface.github.io/bs4Dash), and others bring excellent capabilities for building state-of-the-art Shiny user interfaces.
