Each of these videos will be posted on this site as well as the official Shiny Developer Series [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwQ7lkY6YWzZjT807Itbvtw) & [PeerTube channel](https://peertube.linuxrocks.online/video-channels/shiny_dev_series/videos).
- Special live webinars in partnership with the [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com) to connect with the brilliant developers both within the Shiny team and those creating awesome applications and packages in the Shiny community.
