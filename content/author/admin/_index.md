Eric Nantz is a statistician in life sciences who has been using R since 2004. Eric quickly developed a passion for using and learning more about R due in large part to the brilliant community and its free and open source heritage, much like his favorite operating system Linux. In particular, Shiny has become one of his favorite R packages in his daily work and personal projects!  In addition to this series, Eric is also the creator and host of the [R-Podcast](https://r-podcast.org)
